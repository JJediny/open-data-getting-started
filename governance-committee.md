# Governance Committee

A governance committee gives life to the policy and oversees its proper implementation. This team makes policy decisions, prioritizes data publishing, resolves systemic issues raised by city staff or the public, monitors and mitigates risks, and coordinates communications. During the early stages of the program, this group meets frequently; once the program becomes stable, the meeting frequency can be reduced. Although a formal charter and committee procedures are usually unnecessary, larger committees may find them helpful.

## Members
The governance committee is usually composed of leaders and managers who will be held accountable for the success of the open data program, such as:
* Deputy Mayor, Assistant City Manager, or Senior Executive, who serves as the committee chair
* Council Members or designees (if a law or ordinance was passed and sponsors expect to be engaged on an ongoing basis)
* Chief Counsel
* Press or Communications Manager
* Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer, or Chief Data Officer
* Project Manager
* Agency or department heads or their representatives
* Data managers from 
* Non-government partners (such as open data advocates)
* As needed presenters or other guests

## Meetings

During the formative stages of the open data program, the governance committee meets bi-weekly, as frequent reviews of the developing governance plans and implementation progress are needed. As the program matures, the committee can elect to reduce the meeting frequency to monthly to review ongoing progress and address outstanding concerns.
